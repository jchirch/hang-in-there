# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
This webpage contains a small interactive platform where motivational posters (MPs) are randomly generated. Additionally, there is a page of Demotivational Posters (DPs) for contrast. The DP page has a built in feature to remove individual DPs if they harsh the vibe too much. Lastly, there is an option for the user to create their own MP with a default template.

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### Installation Instructions:
1. In your CLI navigate to an empty directory. 
2. Fork [from this webpage](https://github.com/jchirch/hang-in-there) and clone into empty directory.
3. Open new tab on web browser and enter `cmd + O`.
4. Navigate to empty directory made in step 1.
5. Open and begin exploring.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
This project was completed from a template in 9 days time. I've been enrolled in Turing for about 2 months and have been learning HTML, Javascript, and CSS for 10 days.

### Learning Goals:
The primary objective of this project was to have a lightspeed crash course on web development through trial and error. There were several sub- objectives for this project:

- Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code.
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript.
- Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP.
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM.
- Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM.
- Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps.

### Wins + Challenges:
There were as many challenges on this projects as there are stars in the sky.
I had zero experiance with web development or Javascript, CSS, & HTML before beginning.
Whenever I hit a wall that no ammount of googling or reading notes/MDN Docs could overcome, I reached out to the Turing community for a nudge.

Some personal wins for this project include:
- Reusing logic to efficiently overcome technical challenges.
- Be able to parse a large data set, extract desired information, and generate new data structures with said desired info (a topic I struggled with in the past).
- Having a full comprehension of all written code.
